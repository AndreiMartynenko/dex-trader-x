# 💹 DExTraderX – Decentralized Arbitrage Trading Bot

**DExTraderX** is a decentralized arbitrage trading bot built using **Solidity** and **Golang** that automatically detects and executes profitable token price differences across two decentralized exchanges (DEXes), such as **Uniswap** and **Sushiswap**. It uses smart contracts to perform token swaps and a Golang backend to handle logic, logging, and automation.
